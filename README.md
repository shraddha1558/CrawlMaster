# Web Crawler for Domain-Specific URL Extraction

## Project Description

This project involves developing a multi-threaded web crawler designed to systematically extract and analyze URLs from a specified domain. Implemented in Python, the crawler utilizes the `urllib.request` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries for web interaction and parsing. It employs threading to manage multiple concurrent requests efficiently, enhancing performance and speed.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Threaded Crawling:**
  Utilizes Python's threading to concurrently handle multiple URL requests, significantly improving crawling efficiency and reducing total processing time.

- **Domain-Specific Filtering:**
  Ensures that only URLs from the specified domain are processed. This is achieved by checking if the URLs start with the target domain and handling relative URLs appropriately.

- **Link Deduplication:**
  Maintains a set of visited links to avoid redundant processing and ensure that each URL is only visited once, reducing unnecessary requests and avoiding potential loops.

- **Error Handling and Robustness:**
  Includes mechanisms to handle HTTP errors and other exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the crawler continues operation even if individual requests fail.

- **Politeness Policy:**
  Implements a delay between requests to avoid overloading the target server, adhering to best practices for respectful crawling.

## Cybersecurity Relevance

- **Information Gathering:**
  The crawler can be used as a preliminary tool for information gathering during security assessments. By extracting URLs from a web application, security professionals can identify potential attack vectors and enumerate web resources.

- **Vulnerability Detection:**
  Helps in identifying unlinked or hidden endpoints that might be overlooked. This could reveal potential vulnerabilities requiring further investigation.

- **Domain-Specific Security Analysis:**
  Ensures that only relevant URLs within the target domain are processed, crucial for focused security assessments. This targeted approach helps in understanding the structure and security posture of specific websites.

- **Avoiding Resource Exhaustion:**
  The crawlerâ€™s rate limiting and domain filtering help prevent resource exhaustion on the target website, maintaining ethical standards during security testing.

- **Automation of Reconnaissance:**
  Automates the process of discovering and cataloging URLs, a fundamental part of the reconnaissance phase in penetration testing. This can save time and increase the efficiency of security assessments.

## Technical Specifications

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `urllib.request` for HTTP requests
  - `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing
  - `threading` for concurrent processing
